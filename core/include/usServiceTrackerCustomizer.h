/**
 * \ingroup MicroServices
 *
 * The <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> interface allows a
 * <code>ServiceTracker</code> to customize the service objects that are
 * tracked. A <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> is called when a service is
 * being added to a <code>ServiceTracker</code>. The
 * <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> can then return an object for the
 * tracked service. A <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> is also called when
 * a tracked service is modified or has been removed from a
 * <code>ServiceTracker</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods in this interface may be called as the result of a
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> being received by a <code>ServiceTracker</code>.
 * Since <code>ServiceEvent</code>s are synchronously delivered,
 * it is highly recommended that implementations of these methods do
 * not register (<code>BundleContext::RegisterService</code>), modify (
 * <code>ServiceRegistration::SetProperties</code>) or unregister (
 * <code>ServiceRegistration::Unregister</code>) a service while being
 * synchronized on any object.
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>ServiceTracker</code> class is thread-safe. It does not call a
 * <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> while holding any locks.
 * <code>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</code> implementations must also be
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * \tparam S The type of the service being tracked
 * \tparam T The type of the tracked object.
 * \remarks This class is thread safe.
