       * Framework. If this isn't provided, the component.name property injected by
       * DeclarativeServices will be used instead. If no Configuration is available
       * for either of these, an empty AnyMap will be used to call Updated. Per the
       * OSGi Spec, ManagedService is intended to be used for services which have
       * singleton scope, where there will only be one implementation of a given
       * interface.
