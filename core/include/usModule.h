/**
 * \ingroup MicroServices
 *
 * Represents a CppMicroServices module.
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>%Module</code> object is the access point to a CppMicroServices module.
 * Each CppMicroServices module has an associated <code>%Module</code> object.
 *
 * <p>
 * A module has unique identity, a <code>long</code>, chosen by the
 * framework. This identity does not change during the lifecycle of a module.
 *
 * <p>
 * A module can be in one of four states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INSTALLED
 * <li>LOADED
 * <li>UNLOADED
 * <li>UNINSTALLED
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You can determine whether a bundle is loaded or not by using IsLoaded().
 *
 * <p>
 * A module can only execute code when its state is <code>LOADED</code>.
 * An <code>UNLOADED</code> module is a
 * zombie and can only be reached because it was loaded before. However,
 * unloaded modules can be loaded again.
 *
 * <p>
 * The framework is the only entity that is allowed to create
 * <code>%Module</code> objects.
 *
 * @remarks This class is thread safe.
