 * item -> customized object. Subclasses of this class will act as the listener
 * object for the tracker. This class is used to synchronize access to the
 * tracked items. This is not a public class. It is only for use by the
 * implementation of the Tracker class.
 *
 * @tparam S The tracked item. It is the key.
 * @tparam T The value mapped to the tracked item.
 * @tparam R The reason the tracked item is  being tracked or untracked.
