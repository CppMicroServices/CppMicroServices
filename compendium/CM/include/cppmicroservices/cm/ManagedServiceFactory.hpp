       * The ManagedServiceFactory interface is the interface that service factories
       * should implement to receive updates from the ConfigurationAdmin implementation
       * with the Configurations for the services that the Factory will provide. The
       * service.factoryPid ServiceProperty of the ManagedServiceFactory (or the
       * component.name which is injected by DeclarativeServices if no service.factoryPid
       * is provided) will be used to select all Configurations applicable to this factory.
       * Per the OSGi Spec, the ManagedServiceFactory is intended to be used when multiple
       * instances of a given Service will exist in the Framework, but each with different
       * Configurations. For this reason, ManagedServiceFactory implementations are encouraged
       * to mirror any properties (excluding security critical properties) into the
       * ServiceProperty map when publishing the service with the Framework (if it is going to
       * be published). Clients of the service can then filter on the properties they require.
       *
       * <p>
       * The Updated method will be invoked once for each initial Configuration for this
       * factory and then again whenever any of those Configurations change or whenever any
       * new Configurations for this factory are added.</p>
       *
       * <p>
       * The Removed method will be invoked whenever any Configuration which this factory
       * has previously been configured with is removed from the ConfigurationAdmin implementation.</p>
