C++ Micro Services
==================

Introduction
------------

The C++ Micro Services library provides a dynamic service registry and bundle system,
largely based the OSGi Core Release 5 specifications. It enables developers to create
a service oriented and dynamic software stack.

Proper usage of the C++ Micro Services library leads to

  - Re-use of software components
  - Loose coupling
  - Separation of concerns
  - Clean APIs based on service interfaces
  - Extensible systems

and more.

Requirements
------------

This is a pure C++ implementation of the OSGi service model and a native version of
OSGi bundles. It does not have any third-party library dependencies.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The library makes use of some C++11 features and compiles on many different platforms.

Minimum required compiler versions:

  - GCC 4.6
  - Clang 3.1
  - Clang from XCode 6.4
  - Visual Studio 2013

Below is a list of tested compiler/OS combinations:

  - GCC 4.6.3 (Ubuntu 12.04) via Travis CI
  - GCC 6.1.1 (Fedora 24)
  - Clang 3.8.0 (Fedora 24)
  - Clang XCode 6.4 (OS X 10.10) via Travis CI
  - Clang XCode 7.3 (OS X 10.11) via Travis CI
  - Visual Studio 2013 via Appveyor
  - Visual Studio 2015 via Appveyor
  - OS X 10.10

Quick Start
-----------

Essentially, the C++ Micro Services library provides you with a powerful dynamic service registry,
on top of a managed lifecycle for so-called *bundles* that are contained in shared or static libraries.
Each bundle within a library has an associated `BundleContext` object, through which the service
registry is accessed.

To query the registry for a service object implementing one or more specific interfaces, the code
would look like this:

```cpp
#include "cppmicroservices/BundleContext.h"
#include "SomeInterface.h"

using namespace cppmicroservices;

void UseService(BundleContext context)
{
  auto serviceRef = context.GetServiceReference<SomeInterface>();
  if (serviceRef)
  {
    auto service = context.GetService(serviceRef);
    if (service) { /* do something */ }
  }
}
```

Registering a service object against a certain interface looks like this:

```cpp
#include "cppmicroservices/BundleContext.h"
#include "SomeInterface.h"

using namespace cppmicroservices;

void RegisterSomeService(BundleContext context, const std::shared_ptr<SomeInterface>& service)
{
  context.RegisterService<SomeInterface>(service);
}
```

The OSGi service model additionally allows to annotate services with properties and using these
properties during service look-ups. It also allows to track the life-cycle of service objects.
Please see the [Documentation](http://cppmicroservices.org/doc_latest/index.html) for more
examples and tutorials and the API reference. There is also a blog post about
