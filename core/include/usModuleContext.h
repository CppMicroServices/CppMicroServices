 * \ingroup MicroServices
 *
 * A module's execution context within the framework. The context is used to
 * grant access to other methods so that this module can interact with the
 * Micro Services Framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>ModuleContext</code> methods allow a module to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Install other bundles.
 * <li>Subscribe to events published by the framework.
 * <li>Register service objects with the framework service registry.
 * <li>Retrieve <code>ServiceReference</code>s from the framework service
 * registry.
 * <li>Get and release service objects for a referenced service.
 * <li>Get the list of modules loaded in the framework.
 * <li>Get the {@link Module} object for a module.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>ModuleContext</code> object will be created and provided to the
 * module associated with this context when it is loaded using the
 * {@link ModuleActivator::Load} method. The same <code>ModuleContext</code>
 * object will be passed to the module associated with this context when it is
 * unloaded using the {@link ModuleActivator::Unload} method. A
 * <code>ModuleContext</code> object is generally for the private use of its
 * associated module and is not meant to be shared with other modules in the
 * module environment.
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>Module</code> object associated with a <code>ModuleContext</code>
 * object is called the <em>context module</em>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>ModuleContext</code> object is only valid during the execution of
 * its context module; that is, during the period when the context module
 * is loaded. If the <code>ModuleContext</code>
 * object is used subsequently, a <code>std::logic_error</code> is
 * thrown. The <code>ModuleContext</code> object is never reused after
 * its context module is unloaded.
 *
 * <p>
 * The framework is the only entity that can create <code>ModuleContext</code>
 * objects.
 *
 * @remarks This class is thread safe.

   * Registers the specified service object with the specified properties

   * Other modules can locate the service by using either the
   * {@link #GetServiceReferences} or {@link #GetServiceReference} method.
   *
   * <p>
   * A module can register a service object that implements the
   * ServiceFactory or PrototypeServiceFactory interface to have more
   * flexibility in providing service objects to other modules.
   *
   * <p>
   * The following steps are taken when registering a service:
   * <ol>
   * <li>The framework adds the following service properties to the service
   * properties from the specified <code>ServiceProperties</code> (which may be
   * omitted): <br/>
   * A property named ServiceConstants#SERVICE_ID() identifying the
   * registration number of the service <br/>
   * A property named ServiceConstants#OBJECTCLASS() containing all the
   * specified classes. <br/>
   * A property named ServiceConstants#SERVICE_SCOPE() identifying the scope
   * of the service. <br/>
   * Properties with these names in the specified <code>ServiceProperties</code> will
   * be ignored.
   * <li>The service is added to the framework service registry and may now be
   * used by other modules.
   * <li>A service event of type ServiceEvent#REGISTERED is fired.
   * <li>A <code>ServiceRegistration</code> object for this registration is
   * returned.
   * </ol>
   *
   * @note This is a low-level method and should normally not be used directly.
   *       Use one of the templated RegisterService methods instead.
   *
   * @param service The service object, which is a map of interface identifiers
   *        to raw service pointers.
   * @param properties The properties for this service. The keys in the
   *        properties object must all be <code>std::string</code> objects. See
   *        {@link ServiceConstants} for a list of standard service property keys.
   *        Changes should not be made to this object after calling this
   *        method. To update the service's properties the
   *        {@link ServiceRegistration::SetProperties} method must be called.
   *        The set of properties may be omitted if the service has
   *        no properties.
   * @return A <code>ServiceRegistration</code> object for use by the module
   *         registering the service to update the service's properties or to
   *         unregister the service.

  /**
   * Adds the specified <code>callback</code> with the
   * specified <code>filter</code> to the context modules's list of listeners.
   * See LDAPFilter for a description of the filter syntax. Listeners
   * are notified when a service has a lifecycle state change.
   *
   * <p>
   * You must take care to remove registered listeners befor the <code>receiver</code>
   * object is destroyed. However, the Micro Services framework takes care
   * of removing all listeners registered by this context module's classes
   * after the module is unloaded.
   *
   * <p>
   * If the context module's list of listeners already contains a pair <code>(r,c)</code>
   * of <code>receiver</code> and <code>callback</code> such that
   * <code>(r == receiver && c == callback)</code>, then this
   * method replaces that callback's filter (which may be empty)
   * with the specified one (which may be empty).
   *
   * <p>
   * The callback is called if the filter criteria is met. To filter based
   * upon the class of the service, the filter should reference the
   * ServiceConstants#OBJECTCLASS() property. If <code>filter</code> is
   * empty, all services are considered to match the filter.
   *
   * <p>
   * When using a <code>filter</code>, it is possible that the
   * <code>ServiceEvent</code>s for the complete lifecycle of a service
   * will not be delivered to the callback. For example, if the
   * <code>filter</code> only matches when the property <code>x</code> has
   * the value <code>1</code>, the callback will not be called if the
   * service is registered with the property <code>x</code> not set to the
   * value <code>1</code>. Subsequently, when the service is modified
   * setting property <code>x</code> to the value <code>1</code>, the
   * filter will match and the callback will be called with a
   * <code>ServiceEvent</code> of type <code>MODIFIED</code>. Thus, the
   * callback will not be called with a <code>ServiceEvent</code> of type
   * <code>REGISTERED</code>.
   *
   * @tparam R The type of the receiver (containing the member function to be called)
   * @param receiver The object to connect to.
