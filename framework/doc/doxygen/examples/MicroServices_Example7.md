Example 7 - Spell Checker Client Bundle   {#MicroServices_Example7}
=======================================

In this example we create a client for the spell checker service we implemented
in \ref MicroServices_Example6 "Example 6". This client monitors the dynamic
availability of the spell checker service using the Service Tracker and is very
similar in structure to the dictionary client we implemented in
\ref MicroServices_Example5 "Example 5". The functionality of the spell checker
client reads passages from standard input and spell checks them using the spell
checker service. Our bundle uses its bundle context to create a `ServiceTracker`
object to monitor spell checker services. The source code for our bundle is as
follows in a file called `spellcheckclient/Activator.cpp`:

\snippet spellcheckclient/Activator.cpp Activator

After running the `usFrameworkExamplesDriver` program use the `s` command to make sure that
only the bundles from Example 2, Example 2b, and Example 6 are started; use the
start (`l`) and stop (`u`) commands as appropriate to start and stop the
various tutorial bundles, respectively. Now we can start our spell checker client
bundle by entering `l spellcheckclient`:

\verbatim
CppMicroServices-build> bin/usFrameworkExamplesDriver
> l
Starting to listen for service events.
> l spellcheckservice
Ex1: Service of type IDictionaryService/1.0 registered.
> s
Id | Name                 | Status
-----------------------------------
 - | dictionaryclient     | -
 - | dictionaryclient2    | -
 - | dictionaryclient3    | -
 - | frenchdictionary     | -
 - | spellcheckclient     | -
 1 | CppMicroServices     | ACTIVE
 2 | Event Listener       | ACTIVE
 3 | Dictionary Service   | ACTIVE
 4 | Spell Check Service  | ACTIVE
>
\endverbatim

To trigger the registration of the spell checker service from our bundle, we
start the frenchdictionary using the `l frenchdictionary` command. If the bundle from
\ref MicroServices_Example1 "Example 1" is still active,
then we should see it print out the details of the service event it receives
when our new bundle registers its spell checker service:

\verbatim
CppMicroServices-build> bin/usFrameworkExamplesDriver
> l spellcheckservice
> l frenchdictionary
> l spellcheckclient
Enter a blank line to exit.
Enter passage:
\endverbatim

When we start the bundle, it will use the main thread to prompt us for passages; a
passage is a collection of words separated by spaces, commas, periods, exclamation
points, question marks, colons, or semi-colons. Enter a passage and press the enter
key to spell check the passage or enter a blank line to stop spell checking passages.
To restart the bundle, we must use the command `s` command to get the bundle identifier
number for the bundle and first use the `u` command to stop the bundle, then the
`l` command to re-start it.

Since this client uses the Service Tracker to monitor the dynamic availability of the
spell checker service, it is robust in the scenario where the spell checker service
suddenly departs. Further, when a spell checker service arrives, it automatically gets
the service if it needs it and continues to function. These capabilities are a little
difficult to demonstrate since we are using a simple single-threaded approach, but in
a multi-threaded or GUI-oriented application this robustness is very useful.
