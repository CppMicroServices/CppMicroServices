/**
 * \ingroup MicroServices
 *
 * Represents a CppMicroServices bundle.
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>%Bundle</code> object is the access point to a CppMicroServices bundle.
 * Each CppMicroServices bundle has an associated <code>%Bundle</code> object.
 *
 * <p>
 * A bundle has unique identity, a <code>long</code>, chosen by the
 * framework. This identity does not change during the lifecycle of a bundle.
 *
 * <p>
 * A bundle can be in one of four states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INSTALLED
 * <li>STARTED
 * <li>STOPPED
 * <li>UNINSTALLED
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You can determine whether a bundle is started or not by using IsStarted().
 *
 * <p>
 * A bundle can only execute code when its state is <code>STARTED</code>.
 * A <code>STOPPED</code> bundle is a
 * zombie and can only be reached because it was started before. However,
 * stopped bundles can be started again.
 *
 * <p>
 * The framework is the only entity that is allowed to create
 * <code>%Bundle</code> objects.
 *
